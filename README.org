* Current state

Right now the system is somewhat functioning. It can bootstrap on a
new machine (given VirtualBox), create an image and unmount and image.
It can't do advanced operations (change password, resize disk...). For
that you'll need to use ctp-debug, which will SSH into a Linux with
your disk.

** Multiple VMs

There are some facilities in place to support multiple concurrent VMs.
Some of the code behaves like there are multiple VMs and some just
ignores it. This is OK, this is not sloppy design, it will just be
properly extended when the time comes.
